Welcome to Takka House - a countryside home, a community space, an experiment.

Takka is located in Neueh√ºtten, Wiesenburg, a small village 1,5h south-west of Berlin. This house has seen many different chapters. Once upon a time, it was a restaurant, a dance hall, a supermarket, the mayor‚Äôs office, a saw mill, and several apartments. After 1990, it stood empty for a few decades.

We are just getting started on our mission to renovate the house, dance hall, barns and outbuildings to recapture some of their former glory. While we dream of restoring the dance hall's 1920s wooden dance floor, or bring back to life the antique tiles in the kitchen, we have quite some work to do beforehand.

As a group of over a hundred people, we have different levels of involvement. Some live here full time. Some visit once or twice a year. Some are here regularly to enjoy the house and countryside, help with house projects, or a mixture.

We combine our modern, progressive home life with a community culture of respect for individual choices and expressions of intimacy. Explicitly polyamorous and queer positive. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
