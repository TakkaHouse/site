Welcome to the Takka House - a community project, a home, an experiment.

Takka is located 1,5h south-west of Berlin. Our residence is supposed to be more than just a house; we’d love for it to be a place where individuals come together to explore, connect, and thrive. We're not just roomies; we're engaging in a collective experiment of community. 

At Takka, we embrace a sex-positive, poly and queer-friendly ethos, fostering an environment where love is celebrated beyond traditional ways.

Our home is a living experiment in building connections, dismantling stereotypes, and creating a space where everyone is free to express themselves.

We believe 'home' is not just a place; it's a concept woven into the fabric of our community.
